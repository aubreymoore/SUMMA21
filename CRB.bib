  abstract = {Hemolymph of healthy grubs of Oryctes rhinoceros possesses trehalose content of 380\,±\,30 mg/dl that is five times higher than the content of glucose. Experimental stressors, either internal or external have resulted in the elevation of glucose through degradation of trehalose mediated by the elevated activity of trehalase; the hyperglycaemia was disproportionate with the decrease of trehalose content. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP), an important enzyme of the skeletal muscle of vertebrates was located in the cell free hemolymph of grubs, at an exponentially elevated level of 320\,±\,20 µmols/min/mg protein. Both GP and Hexokinase showed a sharp reduction in activity under exposure to stressors. Accumulation of lactic acid along with an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed. Inhibition of GP activity by hyperglycaemia together with decline of hexokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, proves that the larvae might have adopted an energy conserving mechanism and thereby channelling glucose for the purpose of defense. Elevation of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase during stress may also help them to synthesis defensive chemicals like glutathione and polyols. Existence of such a wonderful biochemical mechanism helps them to thrive very well in cow dung pits a microenvironment possessing biotic and abiotic stressors, without undergoing diapause.},

  abstract = {Viruses are infectious particles composed of nucleic acids and proteins that depend on cells for energy. Viruses invade cells where they proliferate, resulting in disease. Sterilization, disinfection, and antisepsis are important for preventing diseases derived from pathogens such as viruses. The disinfectants used for viruses are mostly chemicals including alcohols like ethanol and isopropanol. Alcohols are effective against enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus but not small non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus and poliovirus. To develop methods of sterilization, confirmation of results using appropriate samples is necessary. Towards this goal, several physical methods have recently been developed to facilitate sterilization; including the use of pulsed light, supercritical fluids, pulsed electric fields, and gas plasma. Although most of these methods have not been widely adopted, further increases in reliability, convenience, and suitability should contribute to the spread of their applicability. In this review, we describe viruses, conventional means of disinfection, trends in the development of new methods of sterilization and potential applications of these methods.},

The RPW is a palm borer insect that develops within the soft tissues of the trunk and crown, eventually leading to tree death. Early detection of RPW infestation is crucial because,at an early stage of infestation,palms can be treated more efficiently and saved,while the determination of treatment efficacy is hugely vital to optimize palm rescue efforts. Detection is often particularly problematic since not all palms can be accessed and inspected directly. Thermography technique can determine the thermal properties of any objects of interest, and it is a non-destructive. In thermography, the invisible radiation patternsaretransformedtovisibleimagescalledthermalimages.Thosethermalimages are acquired using specific sensors that can be coupled with many available optical systems. Due to the simple operating procedure and the noticeable reductions in equipment cost of thermal imaging systems, it gains popularity in pests’ detection. This chapter discusses the state-of-the-art research concerning the detection methods for detecting infected Palm trees.The study will concentrate on the thermal imaging and its application on red palm weevil detection.},

When A. albopictus cells were inoculated with high concentrations of Oryctes baculovirus virus uptake and syncytia formation occurred but there was no evidence of virus replication and thus infection probably did not occur.

  abstract = {During investigations on the pathology of field populations of Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus) in Southeast Asia and in certain islands of the South Pacific, grubs suffering from a virus disease were detected in Malaya. Signs and symptoms of this so-called “Malaya disease” are described. In diseased larvae, the fat body is greatly disintegrated. Fat cells often show a striking proliferative response to virus infection. By differential centrifugation of suspensions of homogenized affected fat-body lobes, spherical viral particles with mostly polygonal contours and an average diameter of 164 ± 16 mμ could be isolated together with a comparatively low number of virus rods measuring about 200 × 70 mμ. These viral sediments proved highly infective for larvae when inoculated into the body cavity. The same was the case with filtrates of homogenized fat body of diseased larvae when filters with a mean pore size of 1 micron, 600 mμ, and 300 mμ were used. Injection of filtrates passed through 100-mμ-pore filters had no apparent effect on the larvae, yet the emerging adults were crippled. Ultrathin sections revealed that the nuclei of fat-body cells are the principal sites of virus reproduction, yet repeatedly virogenic foci could also be observed in the cytoplasm. In an advanced stage of cell infection the hypertrophied nuclei contain crowds of singleor double-membraned spherical viral particles (shells), most of them ranging in diameter from 120 to 230 mμ (mean 160 mμ), and, closely associated with them, masses of virus rods with a length predominantly ranging from 170 to 210 mμ (mean 195 mμ) and an average width of 70 mμ. Both components are identical with the isolated spheres and rods. The virus rods, being the mature form of the virus, have a highly differentiated structure. They are established (1) from dense, chromatinlike virogenic stroma, (2) from loose, fibrillar and granular stromal material, (3) from filaments, and (4) from inside of the single- or double-membraned spherical particles (shells). Thus, the spheres represent viral developmental stages. The virus rods are not occluded in polyhedra or capsules of microcrystalline proteinaceous material. Yet clusters of rods may be densely packed in a two- or three-dimensional pseudocrystalline pattern. The disease is easily transmissible to third-instar larvae by contaminated food as well as by intrahemocoelic inoculation. The period of lethal infection is from about 6 to 30 days. Peroral and intrahemocoelic transmission of the disease to larvae of Oryctes nasicornis (Linnaeus) also is easily effected. The virus cannot be classed with any known group of insect viruses. Accordingly, it is placed in a new genus for which the generic name Rhabdionvirus gen.n. is proposed. The type species of this new genus (the virus under discussion) is named Rhabdionvirus oryctes gen. n., sp. n.},

Pest populations were monitored by palm damage surveys for up to 4 yr on 22 islands, some of them deliberately untreated. The method used allowed estimates from a single survey of the number of beetle attacks during each of 18 mo (3rd–20th month before the survey date). Such surveys gave continuous records for O. rhinoceros attacks during 1983–1987. Most islands where the virus was released showed a highly significant reduction in palm damage. The prerelease pest density on a given island influenced the efficacy of the virus introduction. Adjustments were made for this effect when the performances of the different virus strains were compared. Strain X2B gave consistently better reduction in pest populations and more virus-infected beetles compared with strain V2/3B; the remaining strains gave intermediate control. These results agreed with earlier laboratory tests, in which the virulence of both strains was compared by infecting O. rhinoceros larvae. Two islands where three strains were released simultaneously also experienced a high damage reduction; here, X2B predominated eventually over strains V2/3B and S2A.},

The results and those of previous surveys showed that the baculovirus disease usually has little influence on the overall survival rate of O. rhinoceros larvae, but that it reduces dramatically the average life span of the adult beetles. This and the ability of the virus disease to persist at low host densities are the main reasons for its success as a microbial control agent. The data provide additional evidence that the presence of a low number of dead standing palms per hectare promotes the spread of the virus disease because these are highly attractive to adult beetles. It is concluded from the results that in areas where the baculovirus is indigenous, control methods should be directed against the larval population of O. rhinoceros.},

Ground-up virus-killed larvae of O. rhinoceros were used to prepare the inocula. Similar median lethal dosages were estimated for the different larval stages and for larvae kept under different conditions of food, temperature, and humidity after the inoculation. The period of lethal infection was found to be dependent on the larval stage and on the surrounding temperature. Storage of Rhabdionvirus in sawdust for 1 week reduced the amount of active virus material in the mixture to 0.091\% of its initial value. After 2 weeks the amount of active virus material was reduced to 0.027\%, and no more infectivity was detectable after 1 month. Drying the mixture or raising the temperature increased the rate of inactivation. The sterilization effect of heat and of several chemicals on the virus was studied.},

No virus infections occurred in larvae hatching from eggs surface-contaminated with the virus. Larvae hatching from eggs laid by virus-infected females very rarely were infected. In the O. rhinoceros population the virus is transmitted most frequently during mating, possibly when the uninfected partner contacts virus material excreted by the infected partner. The virus can be transmitted in a similar way when infected and healthy beetles feed together in palm trees. Beetles visiting larval breeding sites containing freshly virus-killed larvae can become infected. Virus-infected beetles can pass the infection to healthy larvae when visiting a breeding site.},

Understanding the dispersal characteristics of such 'beneficials' is of crucial importance for classical, augmentative, inundative and conservation biological control. It is a key practice, following the release of 'classical' (exotic) and augmentative (indigenous) biological control agents, to assess whether they have become successfully established, and also to what extent the agent has spread from the release points. It is important in conservation biological control to understand the role that natural enemy movements play in the improvement of pest control achieved through the provision of pollen, nectar, shelter and/or alternative prey/hosts. Other aspects of predator and parasitoid movement pertinent to biological control are the role refugia play in influencing, via natural enemy movements, control of pest population numbers. In these areas and others, some form of marking and/or tracking of insect predators and parasitoids is usually required so that movements can be studied. This special issue considers the usefulness and limitations of marking and tracking techniques, through up-to-date reviews written by an international team of researchers who are actively involved in the study of predator and parasitoid ecology.},

The pheromone lure, ethyl 4-methyloctanoate, was  assessed for its attractive ability towards the CRB-S and CRB-G haplotypes by comparing the  distribution of the haplotypes in non trap-caught and trap-caught populations collected from  Palau. A diagnostic qPCR assay was designed to detect OrNV, and was found to be a more  sensitive and accurate method for OrNV detection compared to the conventional PCR assay.  Finally, because the newly emerged CRB-G haplotype has acquired resistance to OrNV, RNA  extractions were sent for high-throughput sequencing to discover other viruses present in O.  rhinoceros. Three sequences were discovered to be similar in sequence to viruses of other insect  species.},

Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide.With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.},

This study investigated the impact of the different techniques of residue management in oil palm replanting to the abundance of O. rhinoceros. Two types of breeding sites, zero and partial burning were selected and the beetle populations were determined between three to 18 months after felling and chipping (MAF). At the sixth MAF, different stages of O. rhinoceros were collected from chipped trunks.  The results showed that a high population of O. rhinoceros was detected at the 13th MAF; no beetles were detected at the third, fourth and fifth MAF from both types of breeding sites. The third instar larvae were recorded as the dominant stage detected during the study. The females were found to be more abundant than the males, indicating better food quality and a potential for higher infestation for the coming months. There was no significant differences on the population of O. rhinoceros in both sites. The beetles population tended to increase with MAF. The results of this study suggested that the partial burning of chipped trunks did not decrease the population of O. rhinoceros apart from polluting the environment.},

  abstract = {Hawaii and the US-affliated Pacifc Islands (see Figs. A2.1 and A2.2 for associated map) have high levels of endemic native biodiversity, largely as a function of varied ecosystems and isolation. For example, Hawaii is the most isolated archipelago on Earth where 90\% of its 10,000 native species are endemic. This geographic area represents most major forest ecosystem types and includes thousands of oceanic islands, elevational clines from coastal to alpine in temperate and tropical ecosystems, species and communities that occur nowhere else in the world, the tallest mountains on Earth, and a broad range of governments and cultures. Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable and susceptible to environmental change from both natural disturbances (wildfire, food, hurricane, typhoon,  nd drought) and anthropogenic disturbances (invasive species, deforestation, pollution, and urbanization). Climate change is further exacerbating existing ecological challenges and affecting biological diversity across all biological scales in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This is a global challenge faced around the world, but it is particularly acute in Hawaii and the US-affliated Pacifc Islands, where the loss of biodiversity from extirpations and extinctions is already consequential. An estimated 270 plant and animal species have gone extinct over the past 200 years in Hawaii, with an additional 440 species threatened or endangered (Wagner et al. 1999). Despite the recognized prominence of invasive species in most of the terrestrial ecosystems in Hawaii and the US-affliated Pacifc Islands, it is unclear if this is a result of more invasive species being introduced or if human disturbance allows greater establishment. In general, Hawaii is considered ground zero for invasive species (Dawson et al. 2017), and with many other ecosystems likely to be impacted, Hawaii can serve as a model system through innovative approaches to both reduce the impacts of invasive species and enhance the resilience of native species assemblages.},

Transmission electron microscopy revealed infection with a bacilliform virus containing a rod shaped nucleocapsid enveloped in an elliptical membrane. Assembly of PCR-free shotgun metagenomic sequencing produced a circular genome of 107,063bp containing 97 open reading frames, the majority of which share sequence similarity with a virus infecting the black tiger shrimp: Penaeus monodon nudivirus (PmNV). Multiple phylogenetic analyses confrm the new virus to be a novel member of the Nudiviridae: Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). Evidence of occlusion body formation, characteristic of PmNV and its closest relatives, was not observed, questioning the horizontal transmission strategy of HgNV outside of the host. We discuss the potential impacts of HgNV on juvenile lobster growth and mortality and present HgNV-specifc primers to serve as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the virus in wild and farmed lobster stocks.},

Until now, butterfly mobility has been predominantly studied using visual observations and mark–recapture experiments. Attachment of a light-weight radar transponder to the butterfly’s thorax did not significantly affect behaviour or mobility. Tracks were analysed for straightness, duration, displacement, ground speed, foraging and the influence of linear landscape features on flight direction. Two main styles of track were identified: (A) fast linear flight and (B) slower nonlinear flights involving a period of foraging and/or looped sections of flight. These loops potentially perform an orientation function, and were often associated with areas of forage. In the absence of forage, linear features did not provide a guiding effect on flight direction, and only dense treelines were perceived as barriers. The results provide tentative support for non-random dispersal and a perceptual range of 100–200 m for these species. This study has demonstrated a methodology of significant value for future investigation of butterfly mobility and dispersal.},

The virus disease developed to epizootic levels within 5 months and spread across the island in 15 months. The beetle population was monitored through palm damage surveys, which confirmed that the population was considerably reduced by the disease. The greater impact of the virus was attributed to its much higher power of dispersal through infected beetles. The experiment supports the view that the reduction in beetle numbers recorded previously in Western Samoa was caused by a virus epizootic.},

  abstract = {Oryctes nudivirus (species OrNV) has been an effective biocontrol agent against the insect pest Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) for decades, but there is evidence that resistance could be evolving in some host populations. We detected OrNV infection in O. rhinoceros from Solomon Islands and used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to determine the full length of the virus genomic sequence isolated from an individual belonging to a mitochondrial lineage (CRB-G) that was previously reported as resistant to OrNV. The complete circular genome of the virus consisted of 125,917 nucleotides, 1.698 bp shorter than the originally-described full genome sequence of Ma07 strain from Malaysia. We found 130 out of 139 previously annotated ORFs (seven contained interrupted/non-coding sequences, two were identified as duplicated versions of the existing genes), as well as a putatively inverted regions containing four genes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a long-read sequencing technology for resolving potential structural variations when describing new virus isolates. While the Solomon Islands isolate exhibited 99.41\% nucleotide sequence identity with the originally described strain, we found several genes, including a core gene (vlf-1), that contained multiple amino acid insertions and/or deletions as putative polymorphisms of large effect. Our complete annotated genome sequence of a newly found isolate in Solomon Islands provides a valuable resource to help elucidate the mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of OrNV as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle.},

  abstract = {Recently, incursions of the Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros, have been detected in south Pacific countries that were previously free of the pest. It has been suggested that this range expansion is related to an O. rhinoceros haplotype that is reported to show reduced susceptibility to the well-established classical biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). We investigated O. rhinoceros population genetics and the OrNV status of specimens collected in Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and the Philippines. Based on the sequence of the mitochondrial CoxI gene, we found three major mitochondrial haplotype groups (CRB-G, CRB-PNG and CRB-S) across the region. Haplotype diversity varied between and within countries and a high incidence of OrNV infection was detected in all haplotypes wherever they occurred. The O. rhinoceros population in some countries was monotypic and all individuals tested belonged to a single haplotype group. However, in Samoa we detected CRB-S and CRB-PNG and in Solomon Islands we detected all three haplotype groups. Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) showed genetic differentiation in the O. rhinoceros nuclear genome across populations on different islands and provided evidence for gene flow, resulting in a well-mixed population, despite the presence of different CoxI haplotypes in Solomon Islands. Evidence of admixture was also detected on both islands of Samoa. The current CoxI based method is not a reliable diagnostic marker for phenotypic traits, especially in countries such as Solomon Islands where the mitochondrial haplotypes have come back into sympatry and are mixed. To identify possible mechanisms of resistance to OrNV, further molecular analyses O. rhinoceros in response to virus infection is required. To improve biological control of O. rhinoceros, such analyses will need to be combined with an improved understanding of the population genetics of the pest and the evolutionary history of OrNV in the region.},

  abstract = {The rhinoceros beetles Oryctes boas (F.) and O. monoceros (Oliv.) do serious damage to coconut palms in Zanzibar and East Africa. These beetles breed in decaying wood, particularly decaying palm trunks, and in manure and compost heaps. They lay their eggs in the decaying vegetable matter, often boring well inside to do so. The eggs, white and the size of mustard seeds, hatch in 7 to 9 days. The larvae take between one hundred and two hundred days to reach maturity according to temperature and availability of food; and the pupal stage lasts from 14 to 21 days. Damage is caused by the adult beetles since they bore into the growing tip of the palm: in some cases this kills the palm, particularly if it is a young one, but generally it causes a considerable reduction in leaf area and distortion of the palm. Mansfield-Aders (1920) reports that Oryctes spp. caused serious damage in Zanzibar and that no insect parasites had been found. During the nineteen thirties it was discovered that the scolliid wasp Scalia ruficornis F. was a parasite on the larvae of Oryctes spp. and was considered to exercise considerable control of Oryctes spp. in Zanzibar, although there were no data to support this. Surveys of the numbers of Oryctes larvae parasitized by S. ruficornis have only shown about 10 maximal parasitism and it is doubtful whether this would be sufficient to keep the beetle in check. Agriculture hygiene, such as burying all decaying logs and vegetation, has done a great deal to check the pest. Scolliid wasps have been collected in Zanzibar by several people and, in some cases, introduced with great success in other parts of the world. Recently Dr. Dun of Kew Guinea collected scolliids here and he informs me that these are now well established near Keravat, New Guinea. Although the scolliid wasp has been successful in controlling Oryctes in other countries where it has been introduced I did not feel satisfied that it was solely responsible for the high degree of natural control prevailing here in Zanzibar. In one coconut plantation the Department of Agriculture havc large compost heaps. These heaps breed numerous Oryctes spp. and counts on various occasions have indicated that under 10 \% of these are parasitized by S. rujlcornis. Since numerous pupae and freshly emerged adults of Oryctes spp. can generally be found in these heaps, it would be natural to expect a high rate of Oryctes damage in the surrounding coconut palms. In actual fact, there appears less Oryctes damage in this plantation than elsewhere, where there are no compost heaps breeding Oryctes. While examining the crowns of the palms in this area for Pseudotheraptus damage, I was astonished by the numbers of dead Oryctes adults that were present in the debris that collects in the axils of the leaves, and also very painfully made aware of the presence of the assassin bug Platymerus rhadamanthus Gerst. hiding in this debris. Most of the dead Oryctes spp. were merely hollow exoskeletons, and each one had a sizeable hole in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. In what appeared freshly killed specimens small ants such as Plagiolepis brunni Mayr, Crematogaster nr rectinota For., Semonius schultzei For., Cardiocondyla wroughtoni For. and Tapinoma luleus Em. were often observed cleaning the inside of the dead beetle through this hole. It seemed that there might be some connection between the assassin bug P. rhadamanthus and these dead Oryctes spp., so several living adult P. rhudamanthus were captured and male and female Oryctes sp. were offered for food. It was observed that P. rhadamanthus immediately seized and pierced Oryctes by inserting its proboscis in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. The beetles ceased to struggle after 15 to 20 seconds and the assassin bug spent two or three hours feeding on the dead Orytes. Examination of these dead Oryctes failed to show any obvious "hole" where P. rlwdamanthus had fed; the puncture was, no doubt, enlarged later by one of the ant species previously mentioned. Following the above observations further work was undertaken on P. rhadamanthus. During July 1957 Dr. P. Surany of the South Pacific High Commission visited Zanzibar and searched for the presence of fungous and virus diseases of Oryctes larvae. He is of the opinion that a large percentage of the Oryctes larvae are infected, and that virus and fungous diseases cause a high mortality amongst the larvae. Nevertheless, from an examination of compost heaps and rotting logs it was concluded that a considerable number of adults must l,ave emerged.},

Droplets of 0.1 mg of Krazy Glue, Loctite, and Bowman FSA applied to the pronotum had no effect on the survival of the Colorado potato beetle or plum curculio after 5 and 7 d, but caused  40\% mortality after only 4 h with both the western and northern corn rootworms. The three glues created an effective bond lasting 4 Ð5 d between the harmonic radar tag and the Colorado potato beetle in  85\% of cases and the plum curculio in almost 50\% of cases. There was no detectable impact of the glue treatment on feeding or walking behavior of the Colorado potato beetle. Analysis of the same behaviors with the plum curculio showed no impact on the ability to walk on a vertical surface, the speed of travel, or the duration of travel. There was no signiÞcant impact on feeding by female plum curculio but indication that males treated with Krazy Glue fed less. Overall, results quantiÞed the effectiveness of the cyanoacrylate glues at providing a durable bond with no signiÞcant impact on mobility or behavior of the Colorado potato beetle or plum curculios. However, the toxicity of the glues against the corn rootworms suggests that similar toxicity or sublethal effects may exist with other insects.},

The frequency of the larger Colorado potato beetles crossing bare ground or grassy plots was unaffected by the presence of an 8 cm trailing harmonic radar tag. However, plum curculios and western corn rootworms, were either unable to walk with a 4 cm trailing tag (plum curculio) or displayed a reduced ability to successfully cross a bare ground arena. Our results revealed the signiÞcant impact of vegetation on successful insect dispersal, whether tagged or not. The vertical movement of these insects on stems, stalks, and tubes was also unaffected by the presence of vertical tags. Trailing tags had a signiÞcant negative effect on the vertical movement of the western corn rootworm. Results show that harmonic radar technology is a suitable method for studying the walking paths of the three insects with appropriate tag type and size.

The heaviest tag mounted on the pronotum of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), reduced its mean horizontal speed slightly but signiÞcantly. The mean horizontal speed of plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), was signiÞcantly reduced by a light tag but not by heavier tags. The mean horizontal speed of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (LeConte), increased slightly when a tag was attached. A tag mounted to the dorsum of the Colorado potato beetle and the plum curculio slightly changed their climbing speed. Changes in the walking speed were variable but remained well within the range of values recorded in the literature. The impact of the additional tag weight was within the range of constraints to movement (e.g., slopes, barriers, etc.) normally experienced by insects in their environment. The results conÞrm that tags presently available will have minimal impact on the walking behavior of Colorado potato beetle, provide an estimate of the optimal tag weight for the plum curculio and show that a lighter tag and a better attachment method are required for the western corn rootworm. Because of the ability of insects to adapt to a wide range of landscapes and to their own body weight changes, the additional tag weight had a limited impact compared with the value of the ecological information gathered using this technology.},

Further data to correlate OrNV dosage indices with doses in number of virions/ml could be advantageous so as to explore if CRB larvae or adults may resist infection by a sub-threshold dose. Also the possibility of changes in the HA culture cells which alter the outer coat of the resulting virion, hence perhaps its infectivity towards CRB cells, could be checked. Might it be possible to move beyond HA-culture and develop tissue culture of Oryctes rhinoceros cells for mass production of OrNV as this beetle species is the target? Nuclear genomes of OrNV-resistant and OrNV-susceptible strains of the CRB could be examined for changes perhaps correlated with resistance.

After 16 cycles (isolate 2016-r16), the efficacy of the virus isolate was equivalent to that of CpGV-M on susceptible insects. This isolate was able to control both CpGV-M-susceptible and CpGV-M-resistant insects with similar efficacy. No reduction in the levels of occlusion body production in susceptible larvae was observed for 2016-r16 compared to CpGV-M.},

  abstract = {any forest-defoliating Lepidoptera exhibit long-term cyclic fluctuations in density that span several orders of magnitude. One hypothesis to explain these fluctuations is that they are driven by pathogens with long-lived infectious stages capable of surviving outside the host. The basis of the argument is that, for realistic parameter values, a mathematical disease model incorporating such an infectious stage is likely to show cycles with the same period as is observed in nature. The mathematical model used to make this argument, however, is so simple that it may not be biologically meaningful. In this article, I extend the original model by including two realistic complications: density-dependent host reproduction and host movement behavior. Including density-dependent host reproduction greatly increases the likelihood of cycles; addi tional realism thus strengthens the original conclusion. Including host movement behavior makes the model more versatile, as it allows comparison of the model output with literature data on the spatial spread of insect viruses. This comparison suggests that the spatial spread of the viruses of Gilpinia hercyniae and Oryctes rhinoceros can be explained with a very simple model of host movement, without recourse to complicated mechanisms of dispersal. The introduction of host movement behavior also introduces the possibility of cycles of outbreaks in space and time simultaneously-that is, waves of disease that will reappear at regular intervals.},

  abstract = {In view of the increasing and devastating damage by rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) to coconut palms in the middle of last century, many efforts were made to find an efficient natural control factor against this pest, which could not be controlled by pesticides. The basic procedures of these monitoring programmes are outlined together with the final detection of a virus disease in oil palm estates in Malaysia in 1963. In extensive laboratory studies, the virus was isolated and identified as the first non-occluded, rod-shaped insect virus, morphologically resembling the baculoviruses. Infection experiments clarified the pathology, histopathology, and virulence of the virus and demonstrated that the virus was extremely virulent to larvae after peroral application. These findings encouraged the first pilot release of virus in 1967 in coconut plantations of Western Samoa where breeding sites were contaminated with virus. Surprisingly, the virus became established in the Samoan rhinoceros beetle populations and spread autonomously throughout the Western Samoan islands. As a consequence, there was a drastic decline of the beetle populations followed by a conspicuous recovery of the badly damaged coconut stands. This unexpected phenomenon could only be explained after it was shown that the adult beetle itself is a very active virus vector and thus was responsible for the efficient autodissemination of the virus. The functioning of the beetle as a 'flying virus factory' is due to the unique cytopathic process developing in the midgut after peroral virus infection. Pathological details of this process are presented. Because of the long-term persistence of the virus in the populations, rhinoceros beetle control is maintained. Incorporation of virus into integrated control measures and successful virus releases in many other countries are recorded. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB, Oryctes rhinoceros) is a severe and invasive pest of coconut and other palms throughout Asia and the Pacific. The biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), has successfully suppressed O. rhinoceros populations for decades but new CRB invasions started appearing after 2007. A single-SNP variant within the mitochondrial cox1 gene is used to distinguish the recently-invading CRB-G lineage from other haplotypes, but the lack of mitogenome sequence for this species hinders further development of a molecular toolset for biosecurity and management programmes against CRB. Here we report the complete circular sequence and annotation for CRB mitogenome, generated to support such efforts. Sequencing data were generated using long-read Nanopore technology from genomic DNA isolated from a CRB-G female. The mitochondrial genome was assembled with Flye v.2.5, using the short-read Illumina sequences to remove homopolymers with Pilon, and annotated with MITOS. Independently-generated transcriptome data were used to assess the O. rhinoceros mitogenome annotation and transcription. The aligned sequences of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) (with degenerate third codon position) from O. rhinoceros, 13 other Scarabaeidae taxa and two outgroup taxa were used for the phylogenetic reconstruction with the Maximum likelihood (ML) approach in IQ-TREE and Bayesian (BI) approach in MrBayes.      The complete circular mitochondrial genome of O. rhinoceros is 20,898 bp-long, with a gene content canonical for insects (13 PCGs, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes), as well as one structural variation (rearrangement of trnQ and trnI) and a long control region (6,204 bp). Transcription was detected across all 37 genes, and interestingly, within three domains in the control region. ML and BI phylogenies had the same topology, correctly grouping O. rhinoceros with one other Dynastinae taxon, and recovering the previously reported relationship among lineages in the Scarabaeidae. In silico PCR-RFLP analysis recovered the correct fragment set that is diagnostic for the CRB-G haplogroup. These results validate the high-quality of the CRB mitogenome sequence and annotation.}

The purpose of this study was to determine the ecology of insect pests controlled by fungi Metarhizium anisopliae (MET), Enthomopatogenic Nematodes (NEP) and and the mixture of MET and NEP for controlling O. rhinoceros larvae on the field. M. anisopliae used was in the form of kaolin powder formulation (WP). The nematodes used were Heterorhabditios sp. Nematodes formulation was in the form of liquid with sponge medium contained 10 x 106 NEP in every pack. The study used Randomized Block Design with 3 types of treatment and 10 times repetition on 10 larvae. The result of six weeks treatment showed that the highest larval mortality was obtained from the treatment with the mixture of MET and NEP. Biological control using two biological agents (MET and NEP) is better than only MET or NEP. The benefit of research is for the recommendation of O. rhinoceros larvae control.},

Until recently, however, it was not practicable to apply this powerful technique to low-altitude "foraging" flights (defined by Kennedy, 1985), i.e., flights to find food, mates, egg-laying sites, and other resource items (Bell, 1991). This is because the strong radar echoes from ground features and vegetation ("clutter") usually mask the very tiny returns from insects. In principle, this constraint can be overcome by using the harmonic transponder technique first suggested in 1967 (Vogler et al., 1967) and subsequently investigated for automobile collision avoidance systems (Shefer et al., 1974). In this technique, the target to be tracked is "tagged" with an harmonic transponder, in the form of an electrically nonlinear conductor (usually a diode) attached to some form of antenna. The transponder picks up energy from the illuminating radar and reradiates some of it at an harmonic of the original frequency: the radar receiver is selectively tuned to this new frequency and so is able to detect the transponder even in the presence of very strong clutter.},

A novel virus pathogenic to the beetle, originally designated as Rhabdionvirus oryctes and later Oryctes virus, was isolated from Malaysia and introduced into Samoa in 1963. Later releases took place in Tonga, Fiji and other Pacific Islands. The virus rapidly established and caused high levels of infection that spread as epizootics through the beetle populations. The virus killed larvae in breeding sites and caused adult beetles to cease feeding, leading to reduced damage and a decline in fecundity of the pest population. Researchers reported spectacular declines in the treated populations within 1–3 years of application. Reapplication has proven effective where there has been a resurgence of beetle damage. After 40 years from the initial releases, high palm damage has been reported from some areas suggesting a breakdown of control. Selection of more virulent strains and improved methods of application could overcome these problems.},

  abstract = {Federal agencies in the United States, as well as state, tribal, and local governments, and private landowners are actively working to prevent the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species. Where invasive species are present, they are working to eradicate or control populations. However, with increases in trade, travel, and transport and the aggressive nature of invasive species, existing efforts are falling short of what is needed to address the problem (Seebens et~al. 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to consider new and innovative solutions that can provide more effective and efficient solutions (Conservation X Labs 2017). In late 2016, through Executive Order 13751, the federal government was called on to incorporate technological innovations and other emerging priorities into federal efforts to address invasive species (Executive Office of the President 2016). This Executive Order specifies coordination of such federal action through the National Invasive Species Council (NISC) and through NISC staff, as the operational component of the Council. Following on this, in 2017, the Entomological Society of America (ESA) announced its new Annals of the ESA (Hurd 2017). The new direction was taken to encourage articles that promote interdisciplinary dialogue and consider topics of importance to society. Then, in late 2018, the ESA focused its grand challenge agenda on ‘Addressing the North American and Pacific Rim Invasive Insect and Arthropod Species Challenge’ where the report from the workshop states: Invasive Arthropod Alien Species (IAAS) are a known threat to our quality of life. They outcompete native species, help spread disease, and transform ecosystems. They travel over and through borders, mostly as undetected hitch-hikers in trade and human movement. As global traffic and trade continues to increase, the problem will only get worse. The workshop report also called for continued innovation: We need new technologies and approaches for risk assessment, pre-border and border detection, post-border monitoring, eradication (when feasible), and management of established pests. Existing technologies, meanwhile, can be used more effectively. The invention-to-implementation pipeline... needs to be diversified, strengthened, and ensured. These new tools should not only address capacity issues but also im prove sustainability of our prevention and management approaches. (Hueppelsheuser et~al. 2019) With this grand challenge, the new direction of the ESA Annals, and the 2016 Executive Order, the NISC staff has partnered with ESA to generate a series of scientific articles related to emerging technologies at the nexus of insects and invasive species. The response has been substantial enough to warrant two special issues: one on the use of geospatial techniques and one pertaining to genetics. Here, we provide a brief description of the nine articles contained in this special issue focusing on advanced genetic tools and technology. General information for the nine articles in this special issue is provided in Table~1. In addition to the author and title, we list the species considered, the theme of the article, and the specifics of the genetics analysis.

Therefore, we first tested the applicability of fluorescent marking system on Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae). Then, we evaluated the efficacy of the two methods used either alone or combined in a grass field and bean field, varying with complexity, during day and night. RESULTS: Fluorescent marking did not affect the behavior or fitness of Riptortus pedestris except for vertical walking, while allowing the detection from {$>$}25 m when paired with a handheld laser. Generally, the portable harmonic radar system and both methods combined were more successful in sample detection, although the fluorescent marking system in the bean field at night was as competitive as the two. Combining both methods made sample retrieval easier at night than the portable harmonic radar system. Nevertheless, the total detection time showed a large variance across the methods. CONCLUSION: The portable harmonic radar system can be an effective detection method in either landscape during both day and night. Furthermore, the fluorescent marking system can be a reliable tool at night as well. Lastly, combining both methods can improve the night detection. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

Males typically flew within 5 m of the ground, took erratic flight paths with numerous turns, and frequently circled coconuts and other host plants.

  abstract = {The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the OrNV disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on-site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was thus tested. To avoid the DNA extraction process, the LAMP assay used a 50-fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on-site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the OrNV infectivity with LAMP primers targeting the OrNV\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the LAMP specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with OrNV. The positive results were detected only from the OrNV-infected larvae.},

From 3862 individuals, 110 species and 83 morphospecies from 40 families and 59 subfamilies were successfully collected. From all samples recorded, the five years old oil palm showed the highest Shannon Diversity Index (H' = 3.42), Peilou Equality Index (E' = 0.23) and Margalef Richness Index (R’= 17.33) with species accumulation curve near to asymptote. The most abundant species recorded from the three sites was Elaeidobius kamerunicus with 940 individuals (relative abundance, RA = 24\%). Plot 1 had the highest beetle species with 132 individuals (68.4\%), while Plot 2 was the lowest with 85 individuals (44\%). The t-test analysis showed that there was no significant difference in term of the diversity index (H’) between Plot 3 and Plot 2 (p-value=0.092), while there were significant differences between these two plots (Plot 2 and Plot 3) with Plot 1 (p-value= 0.47 and 0.046). This study would provide basic information for future research in sustainable oil palm plantations management in Malaysia.},

  abstract = {Harmonic radar technology can be used to track the dispersal of tagged insects. The tag consists of a wire antenna attached to a Schottky diode, which uses the original radar signal as an energy source, re-emitting a harmonic of the transmitted wavelength. Two forms of harmonic radar use this basic technology to study insect movement. The more sophisticated form consists of a ground-based scanning radar station that tracks the movement of a tagged insect on a circular radar display. A simpler, “off-the-shelf” form of harmonic radar is a commercially available, light-weight, handheld transmitter/receiver from RECCO Rescue Systems. We briefly review both of these forms and describe our experience monitoring the movement of carabid beetles in agricultural habitats with the handheld transmitter/receiver. We identified a commercial source of diodes compatible with the RECCO transmitter/receiver and tested several diode and wire combinations. We found that a tag built with a diode attached to a single section of 8-cm wire (monopole) was more appropriate for marking carabids. Tags built from flexible Teflon-coated wires were an improvement on tags built with stiff, aluminum wire, but beetle movement was still hindered. In corn and soybean fields, large carabids (Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir and Harpalus pennsylvanicus, (DeG.) Coleoptera: Carabidae) could be recaptured even when they burrowed out of sight 3 to 9 cm below the soil surface. We discuss the trade-offs between tag detection and durability that occur when designing a tag for a given organism. Although the technique shows promise, producing a tag that does not hinder movement of the target insect in the field will require further development.},

With this aim, we surveyed EPNs from 12 landscape sites that included four public/recreational areas, six botanical gardens, and two forest reserves on the island of Oahu, HI. Overall, 35 (83.3\%) of the total samples were found positive for EPNs and out of those samples, 20 (57.1\%) samples yielded virulent strains. EPNs recovered from the surveyed sites were primarily composed of Heterorhabditis spp. Some Heterorhabditis spp. virulent strains were tested for pathogenicity against first instar CRB larvae. Although our study did not show significant effects of Heterorhabditis spp. strains against CRB larvae, some strains inflicted mortality of first instar larvae after 2 days as well as a week after exposure. Our findings indicated that the locally available strains of eterorhabditis spp. could potentially be a useful biological control agent, in an IPM program, to control first instar CRB larvae. However, further research is needed to test virulent commercial strains of Heterorhabditid and Steinernematid against CRB larvae. The results of such studies will uncover if certain EPN strains could be incorporated as a part of CRB IPM program.},

  abstract = {Guam’s established population of non-native coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB, Oryctes rhinoceros L.) began creating burrows in stem apices of several cycad species in a managed garden. We conducted an island-wide survey to determine the spatial patterns of CRB burrowing of stems of in situ Cycas micronesica. We also measured starch of healthy and unhealthy coconut leaf tissue and compared this with starch of cycad stem tissue. The starch concentration of the central unexpanded leaf in healthy Philippine coconut trees was ≈90 mg·g−1, and that of unhealthy Guam coconut trees was ≈40 mg·g−1. The starch concentration of the tissue within the CRB burrow locations on C. micronesica trees was 145 mg·g−1. Burrowing of C. micronesica was restricted to female CRB adults and was found throughout the full latitudinal gradient of Guam. Our findings indicate Guam’s unhealthy coconut trees are no longer nutrient-dense, and the female CRB population may have exhibited a phylogenetically distant host shift to the abundant C. micronesica plants for a starch-rich diet within the concepts of the ‘ecological fitting’ hypothesis. We add proximity to coconut tree habitats as a new threat to Guam’s endangered C. micronesica population.},

Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism for CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For \textasciitilde 40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing countries and islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. However, the situation has recently changed. For first time in \textasciitilde 40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas has been reported in the Pacific, being detected first in Tumon Bay in Guam 2007, followed by Port Moresby in PNG 2010, Honolulu in Hawaii 2013, and Honiara in Solomon Islands 2015. Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g. Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage. Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage, not seen since the introduction of OrNV. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the CRB-G population that invaded Guam could be tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied OrNV isolates. Analysis of several CRB populations has demonstrated that the CRB-G biotype is also found in Hawaii, Palau, and recently (February 2015) in Port Moresby (PNG), with Honiara (Solomon Islands) still to be confirmed. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.}

Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O’ahu, Hawai’i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations. CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.},

  abstract = {The discovery of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s by Dr Alois Huger enabled the successful management of coconut rhinoceros beetle (Orytes rhinoceros) populations through classical biocontrol release in the Pacific, SE Asian, and Indian Ocean regions. OrNV continues to be an important biocontrol agent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of OrNV is commonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its continued presence within palm growing regions and surrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution of the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have established in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle was discovered in Guam and the population has now established with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not seen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has raised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded Guam is less susceptible to OrNV, or potentially resistant. Furthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O. rhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed to have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros invasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of a virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be on the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source populations for the Guam outbreak, a simple PCR-RFLP method has been developed to distinguish Guam O. rhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O. rhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian beetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), has become one of the most important coconut and oil palm pests. This species was detected attacking coconut palms on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi in December 2013, and an eradication program was initiated. One of the major challenges for eradication has been the identification of new breeding sites. Information on the factors influencing oviposition is needed to aid in finding sites likely to host the immature stages of this insect. In this study, a series of choice tests were conducted to assess the oviposition preferences of both laboratory-reared and wild-caught CRB. Mated females, of both lab-reared and wild-caught beetles, were offered for oviposition a choice between sand and two mulch substrates, one with small and one with large particle sizes. Both types of CRB laid eggs preferentially in substrate of small particle size rather than large and none laid eggs in sand. Labreared and wild-caught CRB differed in their oviposition behavior and size. These results can be used to aid in the identification of breeding sites for management programs and eradication efforts.},

On the basis of differences in restriction-enzyme profiles between the two genomes, and previously reported differences in protein profiles and antigenic makeup, we propose the taxonomic status of a variant of Oryctes baculovirus for the Indian isolate.},

In the present study, it was observed that the entire larval growth was affected with this bio-pesticides and distillery effluent irrespective of its experimental concentrations. The reduced weight of the larval forms exposed to different concentrations of bio-pesticides and distillery effluent were clear indication of their deterrent activity and they totally affect the larval growth, since no one was undergone pupation. Even mortality occurred at the midst of this experimental duration in higher concentration. The overall data indicated that the distillery effluent caused antifeedent activity ultimately leading to deterrant activity, of larval forms.},

In practice, varying concentrations of purified virus are preincubated with a fixed dilution of heterologous or homologous antiserum and the unbound antibodies present in the mixture are back titrated with virus particles bound to microtitre plates. The antigenic relationship is described in terms of differentiation index (DI) and total antigenic reactivity (TAR).

  abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication program, we attempted to establish effective microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) imported from AgResearch New Zealand and green muscardine fungus (GMF), Metarhizium majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut Authority. OrNV was initially released by autodissemination but did not result in population suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the Guam population is genetically distinct from other populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is resistant to infection by OrNV isolates commonly used and released in the Pacific region. This novel biotype has been named CRB Biotype G (CRB-G) and it is spreading throughout the Pacific. GMF was released by autodissemination and incorporation of spores into CRB breeding sites. An extensive post- release survey indicated that field mortality from GMF was between 10\% and 38\%. Population suppression by GMF coupled with breeding site sanitation and other integrated pest management tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide CRB outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging from abundant CRB breeding sites generated by this typhoon were numerous enough to kill large numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead palms kill even more palms. History indicates that the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak on Guam is to find and release an OrNV isolate which is pathogenic for CRB-G. We are currently locating populations of CRB-G biotype within its native range and looking for OrNV isolates from these populations which can be used for effective microbial control.},

  abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},

UVLEDs increased the trap catch rate by almost 3X when used in conjunction with pheromone lures. Only 2 CRB were caught in traps equipped with a UVLED but without a pheromone lure, indicating that the light sources act synergistically with pheromone lures. Our use of inexpensive solar powered UVLEDs is novel. There was no significant difference in trap catch rate between traps equipped with standard and reduced release rate lures, even though th release rate was reduced by an average of 90\%.},

  abstract = {The coconut palm is an important plantation crop in India, where it is cultivated on 1.796 million hectares. The rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a serious pest of coconut throughout India and southeast Asia, causing an estimated 10\% yield loss in the crop. Successful biological control of this pest could be achieved using the non-occluded Oryctes virus (syn. Baculovirus oryctes or Oryctes baculovirus). This review provides an account of this microbial agent, its biology, effects and impact, production and maintenance and alternative hosts, particularly in the context of the Indian situation. It also proposes future areas for investigation on the virus, in order to achieve its commercial viability and more widespread use.},

Biodiversitas 21: 2047-2055. Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) is known as a successful classical biological control agent. Recent reports have revealed differences in pathogenicity among OrNV isolates, with correlation suspected between virus virulence and genetic variability. The aim of the research is to study the genetic variability of OrNV isolates based on the DNA polymerase (DNA pol) gene and their phylogenetic relationship with Genus Alphanudivirus. Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) as an OrNV host were collected from Sumatra, Belitung, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. Primers were designed to amplify complete gene of DNA pol. Sequencing, phylogenetic, and investigate genetic diversity scores were used to determine variability at nucleotide level. Five primers successfully amplified the entire DNA pol gene. Genetic variability of OrNV was high, from nine isolates found eight genetically different. Isolates could be divided into two groups of genetic diversity: high and low. High genetic diversity of OrNV supposed as an old population that occupied Sundaland and Wallacean paleogeography at first appearance in Miocene Era until early Pliocene 5 Mya. New population of OrNV had low genetic diversity were travel cross-island that supposed to correlate with oil palm plantation development and the genetic drift. The benefit information of the OrNV genetic variability is as preliminary guideline for virulence test. OrNV is a member of Nudiviridae family, Genus Alphanudivirus, and at recent moment they consist of eight species. Alphanudivirus infect Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Orthoptera order that soil as immature niche may explain their closely related taxa.},

  abstract = {Abstract The infestation levels of O. rhinoceros were investigated in the oil palm trunk heaps in three replanting blocks (Blocks A, B and C) at Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. These blocks had different densities of pheromone trapping: high (11 traps per ha, Block B), normal (1 trap per 2 ha, Block C), while no pheromone trapping was conducted in (Block A. Without pheromone trapping, the infestation levels of O. rhinoceros can reach a maximum density of between 25 to 50 individuals per m2 (IPMS). The O. rhinoceros population was still detected in the heaps up to more than two years (at 26 months after replanting). With high density trapping, infestation levels were maintained below 10 IPMS and was not detected in the heaps after a period of 16 months of replanting. In the normal trapping density, the population was also maintained below 10 IPMS but had sustained itself in the heaps for up to 24 months. The mortality factors associated with the larval stages sampled within these replanting blocks was determined by visual symptoms with subsequent verification with microbial analysis. The analysis was narrowed down to detect only bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis and B. popillae), virus (Oryctes virus) and fungus (Metarhizium). In Block A, the population of O. rhinoceros in the trunks was reduced drastically at 14 months after replanting (MAR), which could be due to the high mortality (88\%) of the third instar larvae, 3 months earlier. In Block B, the percentage mortality for the larval stage was always highest at the third instars (between 21-82\%). In Block C however, the mortality of the third instars was low, never exceeding 35\%. In these sampling blocks, the infection of Metarhizium seem to be less dominant compared to virus or bacteria The k factor analysis indicates density dependence among the third instar larvae had contributed to the change in its population density in Block A. Therefore, with proper manipulation of pheromone traps and targeted application of disease agents (i.e virus,fungus and bacteria), the population of O. rhinoceros can be managed more effectively in an oil palm replanting.},

The replication of three types of OrNV, the  types A, B, and C in the insect cell line DSIR-HA-1179 was studied. The cells were grown in PS100 media containing 10\% fetal bovine serum. The signs of infection in cells by all types of OrNV were clearly seen at 10 to 14 days after treatment (DAT). The infected cells experienced cytopathic effects (CPE) involving formation of high number of vesicle or globule like-structures around the cells. The density of viable cells in flasks inoculated by the nudivirus decreased over time. At 16 DAT, the viable cell density in flasks inoculated with OrNV types A, B, and C was 1.49 × 105, 0.29 × 105, and 4.78 × 105 cells ml-1 respectively, significantly lower (P{$<$}0.05) compared to control flask of 7.98 × 105 cells ml-1. Based on the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50\% (TCID50), it was found that the OrNV type B was more virulent than the OrNV types A and C as it produced high infectious virus particles. The TCID50 values for the OrNV types A and C were 3.00 × 107 infectious unit (IU ml-1) and 8.03 x 105 IU ml-1 as compared to type B which was 7.09 × 107 IU ml-1. The PCR analysis showed that all types of OrNV had successfully replicated in the cells as early as 4 DAT. Pathogenicity study on neonates using cells-propagated OrNV has again showed that the OrNV type B was more pathogenic than the other types of OrNV. The LT50 value for the OrNV type B was 33.47 days, shorter than  the OrNV type A (49.35 days) and the OrNV type C (48.58 days). The DNA profiles of OrNV extracted from dead infected neonates in the bioassay were the same as those from infected gut tissues collected from field population. Thus, it is suggested that the Malaysian OrNV types A, B and C were successfully produced in cell line DSIR-HA-1179.},

The reconstructed flight paths for 66 individuals comprised a total distance of 51 km with high spatial resolution. Butterflies originating from large continuous populations and from old local populations in Finland exhibited similar movement behaviors, whereas butterflies originating from newly established local populations in the fragmented landscape in Finland moved significantly more than the others. There was no difference in the lengths of individual flight bouts, but the new-population females flew more frequently, resulting in longer daily movement tracks. The flight activity of all individuals was affected by environmental conditions, peaking at 19–23°C (depending on population type), in the early afternoon, and during calm weather. Butterflies from all population types showed a strong tendency to follow habitat edges between the open study area and the neighboring woodlands.},

The pH, temperature and humidity in 1-6 months of decomposed EFB was 6.00-7.17, 31.67-39.00°C and 16.80-23.00\%, respectively, whereas 7-12 months of decomposed EFB was 5.33-5.92, 29.16-31.50°C and 23.42-29.10\%, respectively. The 1st and 2nd instar larvae of O. rhinoceros were initially found at 9 months of decomposed EFB and all stages of immature larvae (1st, 2nd and 3rd) were found at 10 months of decomposed EFB. The decomposed EFB at 11 and 12 months showed the highest number of 2nd and 3rd instar larvae with 26.3±1.9 and 40.0±5.8 larvae, respectively. The control strategy of immature stages of O. rhinoceros by Metarhizium guizhouense PSUM04 showed the percentage mortality of 1st, 2nd and 3rd instar larvae with 93.3±3.8, 95.6±2.2 and 75.6±5.9\%, respectively, after treated 35 days.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB: Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus) is one of the most damaging pests to coconut and oil palms in Asia and the Pacific Islands. Adults bore into the crown and damage developing fronds, which affects tree development and yield. The insect is native to South and Southeast Asia and was inadvertently introduced into the Pacific in 1909. It has since spread to several Pacific island nations and territories , causing significant economic impact on these important coconut and palm-growing regions. In the 1950s and 1960s, an international biological control effort was initiated to search for and release natural enemy species. Release of the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus Huger (OrNV) and the species complex of Metarhizium Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) was successful in controlling CRB in its invaded range. Recently a new biotype of the beetle, known as CRB-G, has spread into the Pacific Islands causing unprecedented levels of damage due to the failure of previously successful biological control agents (BCAs) to suppress this biotype. The re-emergence of CRB as a serious pest warrants a rigorous re-evaluation of potential BCAs and a new search for effective natural enemies if necessary. In this article, we review literature on CRB to 1) analyze past introductions of BCAs and their effectiveness; 2) identify potentially important natural enemies and their geographical origins; and 3) assess possible approaches for utilization of BCAs against the new wave of CRB invasion. Research gaps and directions deserving future attention are highlighted and a strategy for renovation of biological controls for CRB suggested.},

This letter presents a harmonic radar system proposed to track the migration of the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). The system offers a unique combination of portability, low power and small tag design. It is comprised of a compact radar unit and a passive RF tag for mounting on the insect. The radar unit transmits a 5.9–6 GHz signal and detects at the 11.8–12 GHz band. A prototype of the radar unit was built and tested, and a new small tag was designed for the application. The new tag offers improved harmonic conversion efficiency and much smaller size as compared to previous harmonic radar systems for tracking insects. Unlike RFID detectors whose sensitivity allows detection up to a few meters, the developed radar can detect a tagged insect up to 58 m (190 ft).},

  abstract = {Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several fights among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale OrNV production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize DSIR-HA-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with TrypLE Express™ with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely TC-100, IPL-41, Sf-900 II and Sf-900 III and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 II (17.9 × 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of OrNV was observed in IPL-41 and TC-100 (4.1 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 III (2.0 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) and Sf-900 II (1.4 × 10(7) TCID50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in TC-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the TC-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Oryctes genus consists of 42 species known across the world, which are major palm tree pests. Oryctes rhinoceros is one of the most harmful pests for the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and the African oil palm (Elais guineensis) in the south and southeast of Asia and Western Pacific islands, although it may attack other ornamental palm trees. The present paper documents the first record of the interception of O. rhinoceros (coconut rhinoceros beetle) at the Manzanillo harbor in Colima - one of the main entry points of imported goods. A single specimen of the insect of interest was collected: a living adult present in a shipment of palm tree furniture from Indonesia, whose final destination was the state of Jalisco. The entomological sample was sent to the Laboratorio de Análisis y Referencia en Sanidad Forestal of the Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Semarnat for its identification. Phytosanitary measures were subsequently implemented in order to prevent the entry of this beetle, an exotic pest, into the country. Furthermore, the document expounds certain considerations regarding the potential economic implications for Mexico of the introduction of O. rhinoceros into the national territory and its development herein.

Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and PCR detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral DNA analysis was carried out after restriction with HindIII enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.},

The growing of cover crops delayed the impact time of the fungus, but it provided protection to the fungus from the detrimental factors, giving favourable conditions to the spores to grow and initiate infection. Therefore, at eight MAT, as the population was significantly reduced, the infection levels were increased to 33.3\% in T1 and 30.4\% in T2, both were significantly higher (P{$<$}0.05) as compared to control (12.9\%).

The virus DNA was extracted from the gut tissues by a robust method. Using a pair of specific primers, Primer 15a and 15b, infection was confirmed when the PCR product produced a single 945 bp DNA band.  The optimized concentrations of the PCR components were at 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM 10X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM Primer 15a and 15b, 0.5 U Taq-DNA polymerase and 0.4 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA).  All tested virus DNA concentrations at 0.085, 0.170 and 0.255 μg μl-1 were suitable for virus detection.  Addition of BSA (20 mg ml-1) at 0.4 mg in the reaction increased the PCR sensitivity. The method is capable of detecting OrV infection from DNA diluted one million times or equivalent to a virus DNA concentration as low as 2.23 pg μl-1. The PCR detected 83.2\% adult beetles from pheromone traps as being infected by OrV, 13.6\% higher (P{$<$}0.05) than the results based on observations on the gut morphological appearance (69.6\%). A typical OrV infection symptom is a swollen gut filled with milky fluid.  Of the 839 guts with this symptom, 97.6\% were diagnosed to be infected which was not significantly different (P{$>$}0.05) compared to the method based on gut morphological appearance. The PCR was also capable in detecting virus at an early infection stage and in dead adults with decayed tissues. Of the 307 adults that appeared to be healthy, 36.1\% of them were found to be infected.  As much as 61.6\% of dead adults with decayed tissues (N = 428) were diagnosed to be infected by the OrV.  The method can be used in further research studies relating to OrV for the management of the rhinoceros beetle.

The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle’s extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear DNA to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle’s native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle’s invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial DNA provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear DNA proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.},

One of the control methods for this pest is by using different potential breeding sites/substrates. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of organic waste substrates as trapping media for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB). The organic waste substrates tested were the saw dust (control), corn cobs, rice straw, decaying vegetables, decomposing banana stumps and leaves and animal manure as CRB attractant in log traps. Among the six organic waste substrates tested, animal manure and rice straw were the most promising substrates that can be used as CRB trapping media in terms of the number of eggs collected, with 56 and 19, respectively. Also, high mortality of developing larvae was observed in these substrates compared to saw dust.}

Bioassay was made by two experiments, one used five SpliNPV concentrations, 6.7X106 , 3.11X107 , 1.1X108 , 3.64X109 and 3.64X1010 Polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB/ml) achieved 80, 100, 100, 80 \& 90\% mortality respectively during thirteen days. Another experiment used four PNPV concentrations, 8.2x107 , 8.2x 108 , 2.6x109 and 8.2x109 PIB/ml caused 100, 70, 67 \& 72.7\% mortality respectively during ten days. SpliNPV Lethal concentrations LC50 6.2x1014 \& LC90 8.9x109 PIB/ml were more than PNPV LC50 2.8X109 \& LC90 1.8X108 PIB/ml. Thus PNPV and SpliNPV were effective against Pentodon larvae but PNPV was effective and specific more than SpliNPV. DNA of SpliNPV and PNPV was identified by RAPD PCR using four RAPD primers, Operon A9, A20, B17 \& B7 (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) using automated (Bio Rad, USA) thermal cycler. Total 33 bands were produced including 24 PNPV bands with molecular weights between 152-1204 base pairs (bp) included between resulted 9 SpliNPV bands having molecular weights between 138 - 1767 bp. Therefore PNPV is similar to SpliNPV in almost its DNA sites and also is a polymorphic copy from SpliNPV. Thus PNPV and SpliNPV can be recommended against this pest.},

  abstract = {The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the OrNV disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on‐site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was thus tested. To avoid the DNA extraction process, the LAMP assay used a 50‐fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on‐site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the OrNV infectivity with LAMP primers targeting the OrNV\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the LAMP specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with OrNV. The positive results were detected only from the OrNV‐infected larvae.}

  abstract = {Background: The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is a major pest of palm crops in tropical Asia and the Pacific Islands. Little molecular data exists for this pest, impeding our ability to develop effective countermeasures and deal with the species’ growing resistance to viral biocontrols. We present the first molecular biology analyses of this species, including a metagenomic assay to understand the microbiome of different sections of its digestive tract, and a transcriptomics assay to complement the microbiome data and to shed light on genes of interest like plant cell wall degrading enzymes and immunity and xenobiotic resistance genes. Results: The gut microbiota of Oryctes rhinoceros larvae is quite similar to that of the termite gut, as both species feed on decaying wood. We found the first evidence for endogenous beta-1,4-endoglucanase in the beetle, plus evidence for microbial cellobiase, suggesting the beetle can degrade cellulose together with its gut microfauna. A number of antimicrobial peptides are expressed, particularly by the fat body but also by the midgut and hindgut. Conclusions: This transcriptome provides a wealth of data about the species’ defense against chemical and biological threats, has uncovered several potentially new species of microbial symbionts, and significantly expands our knowledge about this pest.

These enzymes can be produced by the insect, or by microbes living in the wood and/or inside the insect gut. The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is a pest whose digestive microbes are of considerable interest. This study describes the compartments of the O. rhinoceros gut and compares their microbiomes using culturing-enriched metabarcoding. Beetle larvae were collected from a coconut grove in southern Taiwan. Gut contents from the midgut and hindgut were plated on nutrient agar and selective carboxymethylcellulose agar plates. DNA was extracted from gut and fat body samples and 16S rDNA metabarcoding performed to identify unculturable bacteria. Cellulase activity tests were performed on gut fluids and microbe isolates. The midgut and hindgut both showed cellulolytic activity. Bacillus cereus, Citrobacter koseri, and the cellulolytic fungus Candida xylanilytica were cultured from both gut sections in most larvae. Metabarcoding did not find Bacillus cereus, and found that either Citrobacter koseri or Paracoccus sp. were the dominant gut microbes in any given larva. No significant differences were found between midgut and hindgut microbiomes. Bacillus cereus and Citrobacter koseri are common animal gut microbes frequently found in Oryctes rhinoceros studies while Candida xylanilytica and the uncultured Paracoccus sp. had not been identified in this insect before. Some or all of these may well have digestive functions for the beetle, and are most likely acquired from the diet, meaning they may be transient commensalists rather than obligate mutualists. Broader collection efforts and tests with antibiotics will resolve ambiguities in the beetle–microbe interactions.},

Few tools are available for coconut rhinoceros beetle management, particularly for an emerging haplotype with resistance to known strains of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, the traditional biological control agent used in coconut rhinoceros beetle management programs. RNA interference (RNAi) represents an emerging tool for insect pest control that exploits an existing pathway for gene regulation in the target organism. In this study, we evaluated RNAi as a potential tool for coconut rhinoceros beetle management. Using transcriptome data generated from gut tissue of early instar larvae, we identified 24 RNAi target sequences that were either highly expressed or had demonstrated efficacy in other insect systems. Double-stranded (ds)RNAs ranging from 249 to 297~bp in length were generated for 23 of these target sequences and 150~ng were microinjected into coconut rhinoceros beetle 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instar larvae and adults. Five of these dsRNAs that targeted genes putatively encoding V-type ATPase, polyadenylate binding protein, and three forms of actin induced 30.8–100\% mortality within 14~days post injection (dpi). Microinjection of 2nd instars with 10 and 100~ng of these same five dsRNAs induced 20–100\% and 80–100\% mortality at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively. These results indicate RNAi should be explored as a possible management option for coconut rhinoceros beetle. Coconut rhinoceros beetle may also represent a model species for using RNAi in the management of large invasive insect species.},

  abstract = {Lignocellulose is very potential as raw material for biofuel production because it is cheap, abundant and renewable. The main carbohydrate constituents of lignocellulosic material are cellulose and hemicelluloses (a group of heteropolymers that includes xylans and mannans). The most important process in bioethanol production from lignocellulose is the bioconversion of polysaccharides into fermentable sugar. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been developed because it is the more environmentally approach. Since the cost of hydrolytic enzyme production is the major problem of the process, many type of research has been focused on lowering the cost of enzyme production, including screening for organisms with a novel enzyme. This present study was conducted to isolate and screen of the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic Bacteria from the gut of Oryctes rhinoceros L. larvae. The 3rd instars were used in this research. The research succeeded to isolate 11 bacterial isolates from the gut of O. rhinoceros larvae. The screening result demonstrated that bacterial isolates had cellulolytic (63.6\% of total isolates), xylanolytic (72.7\% of total isolates), and mannanolytic (100\% of total isolates) activity. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence, 10 isolates were classified into Bacillus and only 1 isolate was classified into Citrobacter. The GOR2 which was closely related to Bacillus pumilus vit bac1 has the highest cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. The isolate with the highest mannanolytic activity was the GOR7 which was closely related to Bacillus aryabhattai strain IHB B 6821.},

  abstract = {Pathogens may gain a fitness advantage through manipulation of the behaviour of their hosts. Likewise, host behavioural changes can be a defence mechanism, counteracting the impact of pathogens on host fitness. We apply harmonic radar technology to characterize the impact of an emerging pathogen - Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) - on honeybee (Apis mellifera) flight and orientation performance in the field. Honeybees are the most important commercial pollinators. Emerging diseases have been proposed to play a prominent role in colony decline, partly through sub-lethal behavioural manipulation of their hosts. We found that homing success was significantly reduced in diseased (65.8\%) versus healthy foragers (92.5\%). Although lost bees had significantly reduced continuous flight times and prolonged resting times, other flight characteristics and navigational abilities showed no significant difference between infected and non-infected bees. Our results suggest that infected bees express normal flight characteristics but are constrained in their homing ability, potentially compromising the colony by reducing its resource inputs, but also counteracting the intra-colony spread of infection. We provide the first high-resolution analysis of sub-lethal effects of an emerging disease on insect flight behaviour. The potential causes and the implications for both host and parasite are discussed.},

Current trends of application of DNA marker techniques in diverse domains of insect ecological studies show that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), microsatellites, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), expressed sequence tags (EST) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers have contributed significantly for progresses towards understanding genetic basis of insect diversity and for mapping medically and agriculturally important genes and quantitative trait loci in insect pests. Apart from these popular marker systems, other novel approaches including transposon display, sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-SAP), repeat-associated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers have been identified as alternate marker systems in insect studies. Besides, whole genome microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays are becoming more popular to screen genome-wide polymorphisms in fast and cost effective manner. However, use of such methodologies has not gained widespread popularity in entomological studies. The current study highlights the recent trends of applications of molecular markers in insect studies and explores the technological advancements in molecular marker tools and modern high throughput genotyping methodologies that may be applied in entomological researches for better understanding of insect ecology at molecular level.},

Based on initial delimiting surveys it was determined that it had likely been there for at least two generations before it was detected and that consequently eradication was not an option. Soon after, scientists at AgResearch, New Zealand, confirmed it was the 'G' (Guam) strain of the species that is not susceptible to the nudivirus that controls another strain of CRB elsewhere in the South Pacific. An emergency response plan was developed but due to inadequate financing implementation has been inconsistent and weak, consequently it has spread and is now reported on parts of seven islands. More recently some funding has become available and a three-pronged management approach is being implemented: sanitation to reduce populations by destroying breeding sites (rotting palm logs, green manure, compost and chicken manure), restricting spread through internal quarantines on shipping and biological control by identifying effective entomopathogens for the long term. Work to identify strains of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) effective against CRB-G is reported elsewhere in this symposium. Some preliminary details of work to introduce the green muscardine fungus, Metarhyzium anisopleae, are reported here.},

  abstract = {Rapid and reliable identification of insects is important in many contexts, from the detection of disease vectors and invasive species to the sorting of material from biodiversity inventories. Because of the shortage of adequate expertise, there has long been an interest in developing automated systems for this task. Previous attempts have been based on laborious and complex handcrafted extraction of image features, but in recent years it has been shown that sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn to extract relevant features automatically, without human intervention. Unfortunately, reaching expert-level accuracy in CNN identifications requires substantial computational power and huge training data sets, which are often not available for taxonomic tasks. This can be addressed using feature transfer: a CNN that has been pretrained on a generic image classification task is exposed to the taxonomic images of interest, and information about its perception of those images is used in training a simpler, dedicated identification system. Here, we develop an effective method of CNN feature transfer, which achieves expert-level accuracy in taxonomic identification of insects with training sets of 100 images or less per category, depending on the nature of data set. Specifically, we extract rich representations of intermediate to high-level image features from the CNN architecture VGG16 pretrained on the ImageNet data set. This information is submitted to a linear support vector machine classifier, which is trained on the target problem. We tested the performance of our approach on two types of challenging taxonomic tasks: 1) identifying insects to higher groups when they are likely to belong to subgroups that have not been seen previously and 2) identifying visually similar species that are difficult to separate even for experts. For the first task, our approach reached {$>$}92\% accuracy on one data set (884 face images of 11 families of Diptera, all specimens representing unique species), and {$>$}96\% accuracy on another (2936 dorsal habitus images of 14 families of Coleoptera, over 90\% of specimens belonging to unique species). For the second task, our approach outperformed a leading taxonomic expert on one data set (339 images of three species of the Coleoptera genus Oxythyrea; 97\% accuracy), and both humans and traditional automated identification systems on another data set (3845 images of nine species of Plecoptera larvae; 98.6 \% accuracy). Reanalyzing several biological image identification tasks studied in the recent literature, we show that our approach is broadly applicable and provides significant improvements over previous methods, whether based on dedicated CNNs, CNN feature transfer, or more traditional techniques. Thus, our method, which is easy to apply, can be highly successful in developing automated taxonomic identification systems even when training data sets are small and computational budgets limited. We conclude by briefly discussing some promising CNNbased research directions in morphological systematics opened up by the success of these techniques in providing accurate diagnostic tools.},

  abstract = {Enveloped viruses hijack cellular membranes in order to provide the necessary material for virion assembly. In particular, viruses that replicate and assemble inside the nucleus have developed special approaches to modify the nuclear landscape for their advantage. We used electron microscopy to investigate cellular changes occurring during nudivirus infection and we characterized a unique mechanism for assembly, packaging, and transport of new virions across the nuclear membrane and through the cytoplasm. Our three-dimensional reconstructions describe the complex remodeling of the nuclear membrane necessary to release vesicle-associated viruses into the cytoplasm. This is the first report of nuclear morphological reconfigurations that occur during nudiviral infection. IMPORTANCE The dynamics of nuclear envelope has a critical role in multiple cellular processes. However, little is known regarding the structural changes occurring inside the nucleus or at the inner and outer nuclear membranes. For viruses assembling inside the nucleus, remodeling of the intranuclear membrane plays an important role in the process of virion assembly. Here, we monitored the changes associated with viral infection in the case of nudiviruses. Our data revealed dramatic membrane remodeling inside the nuclear compartment during infection with Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, an important biocontrol agent against coconut rhinoceros beetle, a devastating pest for coconut and oil palm trees. Based on these findings, we propose a model for nudivirus assembly in which nuclear packaging occurs in fully enveloped virions.},

  abstract = {COGEM advices the Dutch Government on the required containment measures for activities involving genetically modified organisms (GMOs). To do so properly, it first has to be determined if an organism is pathogenic, and if so to what extent. In recent years the number of species of (micro) organisms that are being investigated in research laboratories has increased greatly. As a result, the number of applications for pathogenicity classifications has been very high in the recent years.Due to the increase in research involving insect viruses, it is expected that COGEM will increasingly be asked for advice on the pathogenicity classification of insect viruses for experiments with GMOs. Therefore COGEM commissioned a research project in order to examine whether it is possible to generically classify insect-specific viruses.The project was carried out by professor Just Vlak (Viro-Logica). Based on review of scientific literature and the current taxonomy of viruses as determined by the ‘International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses’ (ICTV) the researcher has determined which of the 34 investigated taxa are insect-specific. In the research report a further examination is made of the characteristics and biology of insect-specific viruses including their pathogenicity. The report also includes an overview table in which the most frequently used insects in production systems have been listed and their associated putative insect-specific viruses are indicated.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the coconut rhinoceros beetle  (CRB)  (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is large invasive scarab beetle native to Southeast Asia. CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and  most recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family  Nudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range. CRB  arrived  in  Oahu  in  2013  and  an  intensive  eradication  effort  is  currently  underway.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is to  determine  whether  OrNV  is  present in Oahu’s incipient CRB population, as its presence may positively impact eradication efforts. To date, 21 field-caught CRB specimens have  been assayed for OrNV using a PCR-based assay, all of which have been determined to be negative for the virus. This suggests that OrNV did not  accompany CRB during its invasion of Oahu, and/or CRB on Oahu are resistant to the virus. We also assayed CRB specimens from several locations  in Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands for the presence of OrNV and examined the genetic diversity of the virus within a 945 bp region of the gene  coding  for  the  gp83-like  protein. OrNV  could  be  found  in  all  locations  from  which  specimens  were  collected,  with  the  island  of Guam  being  an  exception. Sequence analyses of OrNV isolates indicate low genetic diversity, which may limit the genotypes of CRB this virus may be able to infect.},

Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation pheromones are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones, and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation pheromones. We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation pheromones with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of pheromones can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros virus (OrV) is an unassigned invertebrate dsDNA virus with enveloped and rodshaped virions. Two cloned PstI fragments, C and D, of OrV DNA have been sequenced, consisting of 19,805 and 17,146bp, respectively, and comprising about 30\% of the OrV genome. For each of the two fragments, 20 open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 nucleotides or greater with no or minimal overlap were predicted. Ten of the predicted 40 ORFs revealed significant similarities to Heliothis zea virus 1 (HzV-1) ORFs, of which five, lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, dnapol and ac81, are homologues of conserved core genes in the family Baculoviridae, and one is homologous to baculovirus rr1. A baculovirus odv-e66 homologue is also present in OrV. Five ORFs encode proteins homologous to cellular thymidylate synthase (TS), patatin-like phospholipase, mitochondrial carrier protein, Ser=Thr protein phosphatase, and serine protease, respectively. TS is phylogenetically related to those of eukarya and nucleo-cytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses. However, the remaining 25 ORFs have poor or no sequence matches with the current databases. Both the gene content of the sequenced fragments and the phylogenetic analyses of the viral DNA polymerase suggest that OrV is most closely related to HzV-1. These findings and the re-evaluation of the relationship of HzV-1 to baculoviruses suggest that a new virus genus, Nudivirus, should be established, containing OrV and HzV-1, which are genetically related to members of the family Baculoviridae.},

Observations after three weeks of treatment showed 100\% mycosis of O. rhinoceros grubs by M. anisopliae and after 6 months, reduction of pest attack from 85\%   to 10\%. The farmer’s practice and recommended practice were less effective with a final pest attack of 83\% and 43\% respectively. Therefore M. anisopliae can be effectively used as   a bio control agent against rhinoceros beetle.},

Due to similarities in pathology and morphology to members of the family Baculoviridae, they have been previously classified as the so-called “non-occluded” baculoviruses. However, presently they are taxonomically orphaned and are not assigned to any virus family because of the lack of genetic relatedness to Baculoviridae,. Here, we report on recent progress in the genomic analysis of Heliothis zea nudivirus 1 (HzNV-1), Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), Gryllus bimaculatus nudivirus (GbNV) and Heliotis zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV-2). Gene content comparison and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the viruses share 15 core genes with baculoviruses and form a monophyletic sister group to them. Consequences of the genetic relationship are discussed for the classification of nudiviruses.},

The percentage of baculovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again. Larva mortality was higher in dead standing palms and stumps than in trunks on the ground. Rainfall was also a significant mortality factor. Palm damage due to O. rhinoceros increased with density of stumps and trunks on the ground but not with density of dead standing palms. It is concluded that in the Philippines dead standing palms can play an important role in spread of baculovirus and regulation of O. rhinoceros populations.},
