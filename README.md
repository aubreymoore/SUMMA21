# SUMMA21

# Hi Guys.

This repository stores resources for guest lectures I prepared for the SUMMA21 program at the University of Guam.

GitHub pages for this repository are available at https://aubreymoore.github.io/SUMMA21/.

Jupyter notebooks can be run interactively on Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aubreymoore/SUMMA21/HEAD)

# Lectures

## How I got interested in modeling population dynamics (0.5h)

I first got interested in population dynamics models way back in the late 70s when I used a programmable calculator to play with the Lotka-Volterra model. Results from a simulated pesticide application were totally unexpected, yet informative.

## A Conceptual Model which Explains How a Typhoons May Trigger Longlasting Changes in CRB Population Dynamics (0.5h)
I will outline a conceptual model and ideas on how to convert this to a methematical model and simulation model which explains how typhoons may cause a semipermanent change in CRB population dynamics.

* Coming soon.
