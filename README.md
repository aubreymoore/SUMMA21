# Lectures

## How I got interested in population dynamics models (0.5h)
I first got interested in population dynamics models way back in the late 70s when I used a programmable calculator to play with the Lotka-Volterra model. Results from a simulated pesticide application were totally unexpected yet informative.

## Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Biology (1h)
A fairly comprehensive overview of coconut rhinoceros beetle biology and (failed) attempts to control this pest on Guam.

## Modelling Cocount Rhinoceros Beetle Population Dynamics (1h)
Modeling population growth of CRB using the exponential and logistic models.

## A Conceptual Model which Explains How a Typhoons May Trigger Longlasting Changes in CRB Population Dynamics (0.5h)
I will outline a conceptual model and ideas on how to convert this to a methematical model and simulation model which explains how typhoons may cause a semipermanent change in CRB population dynamics.

**Resources**
* Coming soon.
